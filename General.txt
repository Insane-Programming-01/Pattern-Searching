Also know as String Searching Algorithm, It is considered a part of String Algorithms

Pattern searching is searching a string withing another string

The complexity of pattern searching varies from algorithm to algorithm.

They are very useful in performing a search in the database

Helps to find patterns in sub string of larger string

1. Naive Searching Algorithm

i) Simplest Method which uses brute force approach
ii) It compares the first character of pattern with searchable text
iii) If match is found, pointer in both strings are advanced.
iv) If not found pointer of text is incremented and pointer of pattern in reset

Complexity - O(m*(n-m)) where,
n = length of text
m = length of pattern
